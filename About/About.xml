	<description>Taking Rah's Bionics and Surgery Expansion back to the basics!  I love Rah. But I also love stupid pawns.  And stupid pawns need prostheses, too!

This mod expands on RBSE by creating an early research project which allows pawns to craft basic prostheses at a smithy.  Basic prostheses are worse than simple, but they make stupid pawns happy!

Also, the research required for installing all prostheses will be reduced by 1 level.  Just because your stupid pawns don't quite know how to make a bionic arm, just yet, doesn't mean they won't try installing one!
